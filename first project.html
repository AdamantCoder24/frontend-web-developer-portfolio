            <p>
                I’m an aspiring web developer passionate about coding and technology. For me, the internet has always been more than just a tool—it’s a place for exploration, creativity, and opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m self-teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building projects to develop my skills. For me, coding is more than just a career path—it’s my way to achieve independence and create a better future.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience working in food service and retail, including my role as a front-end cashier at Walmart, has taught me how to handle challenges, solve problems on the fly, and stay resilient under pressure. I’m now channeling that same energy and determination into learning web development.
